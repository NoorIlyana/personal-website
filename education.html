  <div class="w3-right-align"><p>First let me start with my preschool session. My family registered me at Tadika kemas starting from 4 years old until 6 years old. At there, I have my favourite teacher which is also my mom's bestfriend, I learned lot of things from her through alphabet and numbering. I called her 'Cikgu Moh' or her full name is Azizah actually. She always accompanied me and faithfully wait until my family fetch me at preschool.</p></div>

    <div class="w3-right-align"><p>Second is my primary school. I went Sk Kok Pauh in rural area because all my siblings went to the same school and it ease my parents to send and pick up us at the same time. I also joined as librarian for two years and hold a good position in the organisations. I manage to score well in my UPSR with 3A and 2B.</p></div>

  	<div class="w3-right-align"><p>Third is my secondary school. I choose to just continue at SMK Rantau Panjang instead of accepting MRSM offer. This is because my mum do not want me to stay far away fromm her since I am the youngest one in the family. During my high school, I really active involving myself in sports such as hockey, volleyball, handball, and badminton. Hockey is my favourite sports, I played starting from 7 years old. </p></div>

  	<div class="w3-right-align"><p>Lastly I went to UITM after finishing my high school. I pursue my diploma at Uitm Machang for 2 years and half. I joined sports as well and of course i choose to involve again in Hockey without any hesitating. Uitm specialty is every year they hold sport event called Karisma which is Karnival Mahasiswa UITM. I joined 3 times in different campus and I enjoyed so much in trio years. Aftter I graduate from diploma, I apply to further my education on degree level and again I got same university but different campus. But, at that time covid had attacked our beautiful country that turn out into a silent country because we are restricted to go anywhere and just stay at home. Until now I just spending my whole time by attending class through online version and its tiring day by day. </p></div>
